 2.2 Additional python packages needed to be installed:
	networkx- $ pip install networkx
	numpy- $ pip install numpy
	pandas- $ pip install pandas

3. Steps to run the program:
--------------------------------

 3.1 To run the program from the top, a separate script assign2.sh is provided.
	$ ./assign2.sh

 3.2 To run any individual program, please run the shell scripts in the top down order as listed in section 1.2 as some programs require supporting files which will be
	generated by some preceeding program. Ex:
	$ ./article-ids.sh

 3.3 To run .py programs, please use:
	$ python3 fileName.py

4. Dependencies among the programs:
---------------------------------------

 4.1 article-categories.sh uses the files:
	-> article.json generated by article-ids.sh
	-> category.json generated by category-ids.sh

 4.2 graph-components.sh uses the files:
	-> article-ids.csv generated by article-ids.sh
	-> edges.csv generated by edges.sh

 4.3 finished-paths.sh uses the file:
	-> article.json generated by article-ids.sh

 4.4 percentage-paths.sh uses the files:
	-> short_path.json generated by finished-paths.sh
	-> back_clicks.json generated by finished-paths.sh
	-> human_path_len.json generated by finished-paths.sh

 4.5 category-paths.sh uses the files:
	-> article.json generated by article-ids.sh
	-> category.json generated by category-ids.sh
	-> article_leafCategory.json generated by article-categories.sh
	-> edges.csv generated by edges.sh

 4.6 category-subtree-paths.sh uses the files:
	-> article.json generated by article-ids.sh
	-> category.json generated by category-ids.sh
	-> edges.csv generated by edges.sh

 4.7 category-pairs.sh uses the files:
	-> article.json generated by article-ids.sh
	-> articleAllCategory.json generated by category-subtree-paths.sh

 4.8 category-ratios.sh uses the files:
	-> short_path.json generated by finished-paths.sh
	-> back_clicks.json generated by finished-paths.sh
	-> human_path_len.json generated by finished-paths.sh
	-> articleAllCategory.json generated by category-subtree-paths.sh

5. Program runtime:
-----------------------
	The optimistic runtime of the program when run from the top (assign2.sh) is - 15 minutes. Please allow the kernel to run for this time.
